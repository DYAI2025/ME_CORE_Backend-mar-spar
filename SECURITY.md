| 0.x.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to: **security@dyai2025.com**
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
5. Include your contact information for follow-up

### üìã What to Include

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Location** (specific file/component affected)
- **Impact** (what an attacker could achieve)
- **Reproduction steps** (clear, step-by-step instructions)
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: 48 hours
- **Triage**: 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

### üéØ Scope

**In Scope:**
- MarkerEngine Core Backend API
- Frontend Dashboard Application
- CI/CD Pipeline Security
- Docker Container Configuration
- Database Security
- Authentication & Authorization

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service attacks

### üèÜ Recognition

We maintain a security hall of fame for researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- Your name will be listed (with permission)
- Recognition in release notes
- Direct communication with our security team

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** (use environment variables)
2. **Use parameterized queries** (prevent SQL injection)
3. **Validate all inputs** (sanitize user data)
4. **Use HTTPS everywhere** (encrypt data in transit)
5. **Keep dependencies updated** (patch known vulnerabilities)
6. **Follow least privilege principle** (minimal required permissions)

### For Deployment

1. **Use strong passwords** for all accounts
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** where possible
3. **Keep systems updated** (OS, runtime, dependencies)
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Use encrypted storage** for sensitive data
6. **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

### Environment Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Authentication
SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-secret>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-signing-secret>

# Database Security  
DATABASE_URL=<encrypted-connection-string>
DATABASE_SSL_MODE=require

# API Security
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
HTTPS_ONLY=true

# Monitoring
SECURITY_LOGGING=true
AUDIT_LOGGING=true
```

#### Security Headers

Ensure these security headers are configured:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## Automated Security

### CI/CD Security Checks

Our pipeline includes:

- **Dependency scanning** (Safety, npm audit)
- **Static code analysis** (Bandit, CodeQL)
- **Container scanning** (Trivy)
- **License compliance** checking
- **Secret detection** (custom checks)

### Security Monitoring

Production deployments include:

- **Real-time log monitoring**
- **Intrusion detection**
- **Anomaly detection**
- **Vulnerability alerts**
- **Security metrics dashboard**

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Description |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 4 hours | Complete system compromise possible |
| **High** | 24 hours | Significant security impact |
| **Medium** | 1 week | Moderate security risk |
| **Low** | 1 month | Minor security improvement |
